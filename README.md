# Boilerplate

This repository represents my personal preferences in project structure. The stack is as folllows:

- Next.js as the application framework
- Payload CMS for content management
- SQLite for the database
- SCSS Modules for styling
- Open Props for design tokens
- Radix UI for unstyled UI components
